### Huffman Coding Using Python
This project was done as mini project. Here, Huffman algorithm is used to convert string to the Huffman codes 
and to compress/decompress a file.

#### Testing / Running the program

1. Clone the repository


2. The program consists of two python files, `huffman.py` and `use.py`. To convert string to respective huffman code,run `huffman.py`.
   
    
3. To compress a file, you can use `use.py`, the **compress_decompress()** function will perform compression and decompression
simultaneously on the file of `path`. the **choose_own_file()** will allow user to browse for a file and compress them. The mapping key will
   be stored in `key.json` file. Using the key, user can again choose the compressed file and decompress it
sample file.
