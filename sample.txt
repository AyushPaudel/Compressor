Huﬀman coding example
Now we assign codes to the tree by placing a 0 on every left branch and a 1 on
every right branch
A traversal of the tree from root to leaf give the Huﬀman code for that particular leaf
character
These codes are then used to encode the string

Huﬀman coding
Coding: Assigning binary codewords to (blocks of) source symbols
Huﬀman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm.
Idea:

Assign variable-length codes to input characters, based on the frequencies of
corresponding characters.
The most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent
character gets the largest code.Huﬀman coding
There are mainly two major parts in Huﬀman Coding
1. Build a Huﬀman Tree from input characters.
2. Traverse the Huﬀman Tree and assign codes to characters.Building a Huﬀman tree
1. Organize the entire character set into a row, ordered according to frequency
from highest to lowest (or vice versa). Each character is now a node at the
leaf level of a tree
2. Find two nodes with the smallest combined frequency weights and join
them to form a third node, resulting in a simple two-level tree. The weight of
the new node is the combined weights of the original two nodes.
3. Repeat step 2 until all of the nodes, on every level, are combined into a single
tree.
